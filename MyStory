The mad titan, Thanos plans to shred the universe down to its last atoms with the help of his minions by using the infinity stones which Iron Man had collected to finish Thanos and his minions.
Iron Man now collects all the infinity stones from the rubble of Thanos' attacks, dodges his minions and Thanos himself and completes the nano gauntlet. He then snaps his fingers to finish Thanos and his minions for once and for all by sacrificing himself.
Iron Man will be remembered throughout Earth's history.
